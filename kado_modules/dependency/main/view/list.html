    <p>Kado is built largely upon open source software that has been created as part of the <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> revolution.</p>
    <p>The primary Kado code is built and maintained by the <a href="https://www.nullivex.com">Nullivex Web Consortium</a>. Which follows the <a href="/doc/kado/3.x/release-cycle">Kado Release Schedule</a>.</p>
    <p>Kado comprises of many open source dependencies that really make Kado great, and for that we say thank you! A non exhaustive list is provided below. If you see something missing <a href="/content/contact">Contact Us</a>!</p>
